This repository contains a reproduction of the research Price Discrimination with Fairness Constraints, which was originally published in [Management Scinece](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2022.4317). Please note that this is not an official repository maintained by the original authors.



## Overviwe
In this reproduction, we aim to recreate the experiments and results reported in the original research paper. We follow the methodology described in the paper as closely as possible, using the same dataset, parameters, and evaluation metrics.

The repository contains code for reproducing the experiments in the paper. All reproducible experiments are available in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Specifically, it includes:
- [x] Code for Example 1 Impossibility When Mean Valuations Are Equal).
- [x] Code for Theorem 2 Impact of Imposing a Little Fairness on Social Welfare
- [x] Code for Chapter 3 Analysis for Linear Demand

- Note that Impact of fairness under logistic demand can be implemented in the same way as in Chapter 3.
